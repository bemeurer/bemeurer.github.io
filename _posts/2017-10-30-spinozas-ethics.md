In order to understand Spinoza's Ethics we must begin by familiarizing ourselves with his definitions.

#### I. Self-Causation

> I. By that which is self-caused, I mean that of which the essence involves existence, or that of which the nature is only conceivable as existent.

This concept flows quite naturally, it simply states self-causation as a property of something which is inconceivable as nonexistent. Self-caused things never *came* into existence, they have always existed. He does not give any examples at first, but we will see a self-caused substance later on.

#### II. Finiteness

> II. A thing is called finite after its kind, when it can be limited by another thing of same nature; for instance, a body is called finite because we always conceive another greater body. So, also, a thought is limited by another thought, but a body is not limited by thought, nor a thought by body.



#### III/IV. Attribute & Substance

I will present these two concepts together due to the fact that they are dangerously similar. Fundamentally, the difference between an attribute and a substance in Spinoza's Ethics is a nuance, and much discussion exists on what truly *is* the difference between them, what follows is my understanding, and  in no way is an unquestionable interpretation of his meaning[^1]. In Ethics he writes,

> III. By substance, I mean that which is in itself, and is conceived through
> itself: in other words, that of which a conception can be formed
> independently of any other conception.
>
> IV. By attribute, I mean that which the intellect perceives as constituting
> the essence of substance.

Although the language here is unhelpful at best, a useful way to consider this is thinking of attributes as ways, lights, points of view through which we can comprehend a substance. That is to say, take extension[^2], the example he gives of an attribute, if we assumed, say, our body to be a substance (we will later see this not to be true), it is clear that it can be perceived through extension or, in other words, that out intellect can see the body through the "light" of extension. Spinoza gives extension as an example of an attribute, since it's conceived in and of itself. It is interesting to contrast here, for example, extension and motion, it becomes clear then that the latter is *not* an attribute, for its conception involves extension (there could be no motion without a prior notion of space). So, to reiterate, a substance is something which depends on nothing else to be described/conceived and an attribute is a way we can perceive/understand a substance.

Formally, let {%katex%}\mathcal C{%endkatex%} denote the set of all characteristics of things, it includes things such as motion, which is a characteristic of a substance under the light of extension, volume, weight, and so on. Now consider the set of all substances {%katex%}\mathcal S{%endkatex%}, we can understand an attribute as being a function {%katex%}a(s){%endkatex%} such that
{%katex display%}
    a\colon S\in\mathcal P(\mathcal S) \to \mathcal P(\mathcal C)
{%endkatex%}
In other words, an attribute maps a substance to a set of characteristics, and different attributes will map into different characteristics, different ways to perceive the substance. Note that for a given {%katex%}a{%endkatex%}, not all substances in {%katex%}S{%endkatex%} are necessarily valid inputs. In other words, there could be a substance which we cannot characterize through extension, for example (we will later see this not to be the case.)

#### V. Mode

> V. By mode, I mean the modifications[^3] of substance, or that which exists
> in, and is conceived through, something other than itself

We will later on see why this concept is important, but for now we can simply understand a mode as something which is conceived through a substance. The substance which the mode exists in sets the attributes through which the mode can be perceived through.

#### VI. God

> VI. By God, I mean a being absolutely infinite -- that is, a substance
> consisting of infinite attributes, of which each expresses eternal and
> infinite essentiality.

> I say absolutely infinite, not infinite after its kind: for, of a thing
> infinite only after its kind, infinite attributes may be denied; but that
> which is absolutely infinite, contains in its essence whatever expresses
> reality, and involves no negation.

Here I am partial to assume a slight mistake on Spinoza's part, for if a substance were to be *composed* of attributes, then it couldn't be conceived through itself and independently of any other conception, it would depend on the conception of its attributes. We will assume he meant that God is such that, if we consider the

#### VII. Freedom

> VII. That thing is called free, which exists solely by necessity of its own
> nature, and of which the action is determined by itself alone. On the other
> hand, that thing is necessary, or rather constrained, which is determined by
> something external to itself to a fixed and definite method of existence or
> action.

#### VII. Eternity

> VIII. By eternity, I mean existence itself, in so far as it is conceived
>  necessarily to follow solely from the definition of that which is eternal.

> Existence of this kind is conceived as an eternal truth, like the essence of
> a thing, and, therefore, cannot be explained by means of continuance or
> time, though continuance may be conceived without a beginning or an end.

Here it's important to contrast Spinozistic Eternity with the concept of sempiternity. Usually when we refer to eternity we are, in fact, referring to the concept of sempiternity, which is the idea of that which is always living, enduring forever. Here we mean *true* eternity, which refers to absolute limitlessness.
