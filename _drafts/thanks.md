title: "Thank you"

---

- Daniel Sank
  - Thanks for always being by my side when I needed you. If not for you I am not sure what I would've done with the despair that struck me in Lisbon. You're an awesome teacher, thank you for teaching me what you know, and for always being patient and understanding while doing so. I started talking to you because I thought you'd be a good mentor, and I got much more than I ever could have hoped for. There's not much to say because you *know* you're my absolute bro.
- David McKee
  - Thank you for sharing with me so much knowledge regarding computing. I really learned a lot from you, specially regarding algorithms and pointer manipulation. Thanks for making me feel so confident in my own skills and yet being always there to give me a push when needed. I'll always be proud of writing that nice implementation of Merge Sort on doubly-linked lists, and I only managed to do it because of what you taught me.
- John Rennie
  - John, thank you for your incomparable generosity and willingness to help. When I moved out of home and didn't have a laptop you swiftly mailed me one without asking for anything in return. When I wanted to build my stereo but didn't have budget for an amplifier, you once again helped without thinking twice, and donated me one you had. When I needed help with C you were always available and extremely helpful, thank you for teaching me how to combine function pointers with structs. I hope I manage to be as generous and well-intentioned as you one day. Without you I wouldn't be writing this (on that very same E6530!)
- Kathleen Unger
  - The fact that someone as nice as you exists gives me some hope in the world. Really, Kat, you are just wonderful. It does not matter what problem I have (sadness, homework overload, boredom, anything), you are always invariably there to help me. When I decided on extreme short notice that I wanted to leave Lisbon, it was *you* who helped me with my essays and everything else. Thank tou for caring so much and being so loving and present.
- Michelle Unger
  - While most people complain about your lack of responsiveness, I always felt quite the opposite to be true. Thank you for *always* being there for me when I needed a hand. You met with me, a complete stranger until then, out of pure good will, and I really appreciated that, despite the [pickle shots]({{site.url}}/images/thanks/pickle-shot.jpg). Later that year I came to LA again and you took me into your house without a second thought and I felt really loved and cared for. Thank you for taking me in as family, I really can't tell you enough how much I appreciate that.
- Ryan Unger
  - I think we both know very well that without your overwhelming help I would *not* have passed that Analysis course. You single-handedly picked me up from the dirt and taught me pretty much all (the little) I know about the subject. Thank you for finding time among your borderline obscene number of classes to help me so thoroughly. Thank you for, without even knowing me, taking me into your family, that's big part of why I don't feel so alone anymore.
