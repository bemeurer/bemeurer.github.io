In order to understand Spinoza's Ethics we must begin by familiarizing ourselves with his terminology. Firstly, we must understand what an *Attribute* is for him. Spinoza says the following

> An attribute is everything that is conceived through itself and in itself, so that its conception does not involve the conception of anything else.

He gives [extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(metaphysics)) as an example of an attribute, since it's conceived in an of itself. It is interesting to contrast here, for example, extension and motion, it becomes clear then that the latter is *not* an attribute, for its conception involves extension.
