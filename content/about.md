⟵ Me

Hey there, I'm Bernardo and I'm a Mathematics student. I set up this blog to share
some of the projects I work on, immediately after that, however, my free time was
pulverized. I enjoy running Linux on potato-like computers (and on actual
potatos!), arbitrary precision arithmetics, and weird C bugs. I'm a quantum
computing enthusiast as well.

I did some work on [factorial algorithms][fact] a while back, and I'm working on
[cappy][cappy], [an implementation of Euler's Totient][euler], and an [Ackermann
calculator][ack]. I maintain a [beautifier for Bash][beautysh], and I'm working
on my own Rust-based OS called [Daedalos][daedalos]. I interned at
[Async][async] for a while, and I'm now working for [Standard
Cognition][standard]. You can always contact me at
[meurerbernardo@gmail.com](mailto://meurerbernardo@gmail.com).

I'm an advocate for Open Source software and freedom of speech. Here are, for
curiosity's sake, some other things I enjoy:

* Music
  * Grieg, Edvard
  * Ravel, Maurice
  * Rachmaninoff, Sergei
  * King Gizzard and The Lizard Wizard
  * Black Flag
  * Death Grips

* Movies
  * Apocalypse Now
  * The Seventh Seal
  * Wild Strawberries
  * The Great Beauty

* Books
  * The Tale of The Unknown Island - José Saramago
  * The Stranger - Albert Camus
  * The World As Will and Representation - Arthur Schopenhauer
  * In Defense of Lost Causes - Slavoj Žižek
  * Buddenbrooks - Thoman Mann
