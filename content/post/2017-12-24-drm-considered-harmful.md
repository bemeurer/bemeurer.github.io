In the Digital Era, copyright has become harder to enforce than ever before. Digital works are subject to copying without any quality degradation, which encourages piracy and can lead to market failure, as pointed out by Dr. Marcella Favale, a fellow at the University of Glasgow (118). While some optimists (Goldstein 236) claim that digital rights management (DRM) is a successful technology, protecting copyrights in the digital world, and safeguarding markets and creators alike, the truth is quite the opposite. Since current implementations of DRM unjustly and broadly harden access to copyrighted works, they represent a disconnect with the fundamental concepts of copyright, breaking with the Lockean principles for appropriation which are the bedrock for property rights. DRM should be an instrument to defend copyright, not hinder it, and therefore it should either be implemented such that it respects the rights of users and owners, or not be implemented at all.
