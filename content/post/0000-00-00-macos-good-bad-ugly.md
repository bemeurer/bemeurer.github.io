## Introduction

As far as people's usual interaction with computers go, I think I've had a
fairly unusual story, even for someone who works in the industry.
I grew up in Brazil, where electronics are particularly expensive, and to add
insult to injury one of the few things my parents seemed to not argue about was
how much they hated computers. Unsurprisingly, then, I grew up with a desktop
that was all-around garbage and running Windows on it, from XP to 7, was a
painful endeavor.

Luckily, when I was around 7 we had Bring Your Father to School Day, and one of my
classmates' father worked at Canonical and gave us all Ubuntu CDs. I installed
Ubuntu when I got home, which was pretty painless and easy, and it kind of just
worked. From then on, and for the last 14 years and counting, I've only used
Linux. I eventually transitioned from Ubuntu, to Arch, and then finally to
Gentoo where I've settled in the last little while.

So, to close up this introduction, in my 20 years on Earth I have barely used
Windows or macOS, and mostly used a variety of different Linux desktop
environments (Gnome 2 & 3, Mate, KDE 4 & 5, XFCE, LXDE, LXQT, i3, Sway) having
become quite comfortable with the Linux ecosystem over the years. About six
months ago I started a new job and was given a MacBook Pro, and so this story
began.

## The Good

I've always wanted to give macOS[^1] a try, it always looked very beautiful and
polished to me. On top of that, there were certain applications that I had been
interested in trying for a while, and that only ran on macOS. On top of this,
the MacBook Pro's always seemed to me like the golden standard in hardware, they
were gorgeous and seemed to always work smoothly when I saw others use them.
Over the years I had grown to like the MacBooks so much I almost fantasized
about owning one.

Six months in, I can say that some of my admiration was well deserved. Overall I
find that the graphical experience on macOS is beautifully consistent, the
entire OS just feels coherent and nice to use. Overall I just really like the
look & feel of macOS, specially Mojave with its very comfortable Dark Mode.

Another thing that I really liked was having the Numbers/Pages/Keynote a

[^1]: Note that I am specifically referring to my experience using macOS High
      Sierra and Mojave.
