I've been interesting in having a personal website/blog for quite a while now, it's probably been some 2-3 years since I first decided to put something on-line. In this time, I've gone through quite a few different setups, most of which kind of sucked, until I found the one I have currently, and which I am finally (almost) entirely happy with. In this post I want to both go through which setups I've had, what was good and bad about them, as well as to give a short tutorial on copying what I currently have

## GitHub Pages + Jekyll
